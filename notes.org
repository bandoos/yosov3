* Objectives
  - use a pretrained cv model for object detection
  - expose the service as FastAPI prediction server
  - explore prediction service fundamentals
  - provide an example client that consumes the service

* Extras
  - Monitoring the service
    - opentelemetry + zipkin
    - prometheus for numeric metrics

  - make the choice of exporter configurable
    - understand how to add custom spans
    - with attributes?
  - dependency injection in handlers
  - exclude /metrics endpoint from OpenTelemetry
  - docker compose full stack

* Todo
  - explore deployment solutions
  - custom prometheus metrics
    - e.g. number of null predictions
    - or other domain specific metrics
